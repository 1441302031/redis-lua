v2.0.0 (2010-xx-xx)
  * Support for long names of Redis commands has been dropped, the client now 
    uses the same command names as defined by Redis.

  * Inline and bulk requests are not supported anymore and the related code 
    has been removed from the library. Commands are defined as multibulk 
    requests by default.

v1.0.1 (2010-07-30)
  * Providing a more generalized version of the multibulk request serializer.

  * _G is now passed as the argument of a pipeline block. This will change in 
    a future major release of redis-lua, but for now it is useful to enable 
    the usage of global functions inside of a pipeline block.

  * Fix: user-added commands were not available when pipelining commands.

v1.0.0 (2010-06-02)
  * First versioned release of redis-lua
